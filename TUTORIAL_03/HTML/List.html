      <dd>
        In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a
        specific task. It can take inputs (called parameters or arguments),
        process them, and return an output. Functions help in organizing code
        into manageable sections, making it more readable, reusable, and easier
        to debug. They can be defined by the programmer or provided by the
        programming language as built-in functions.

      <dd>
        An array is a group of similar elements or data items of the same type
        collected at contiguous memory locations. In simple words, we can say
        that in computer programming, arrays are generally used to organize the
        same type of data.

      <dt style="background-color: blueviolet; font-size: larger;font-family:sen-serif;">Loop</dt>
      <dd>
        Looping means repeating something over and over until a particular
        condition is satisfied. A for loop in Python is a control flow statement
        that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the
        condition is satisfied.

      <dt style="background-color: blueviolet;font-size: larger;font-family:sen-serif;">Variable</dt>
      <dd >
        In programming, a variable is a named storage location in memory that
        holds a value which can be changed during the execution of a program.
        Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated
        by the program. Each variable has a name, a type, and a value.
