// * Here is some the HTML Tag that I have Mastered .

 /*   1.<h1> to <h6> :: Heading Tag :HTML offers six heading tags, from <h1> to <h6>, each displaying the heading in a different font size.

      2. <p> & <br> :: HTML <p> tags are used to write paragraph statements on a webpage. They start with the <p> tag and end with </p>. The HTML <br> tag is used to insert a single line break and does not require a closing tag. In HTML, the break tag is written as <br>.

      3. <hr> ::  The HTML <hr> tag is used to divide a page into sections by creating a horizontal line that spans from the left to the right side of the page. This is an empty tag and does not require a closing tag or any additional attributes.

      4. <img src="" > :: The <img> tag is used to insert an image into a webpage. The source of the image is specified within the src attribute, like this: <img src=”source_of_image”>.

      5. <pre></pre> :: The HTML <pre> tag is used for pre-formatted text. It keeps the original spaces and line breaks exactly as they are in the code. When you use <pre>, the text appears in a fixed-width font, preserving the formatting and layout just as it looks in the HTML code.

      6.<em> & <strong> :: These tags denote the logical or semantic value of the text. They convey meaning without directly affecting the visual appearance.
                               <em>: Emphasizes text (commonly styled as italic).
                               <strong>: Indicates important content (often styled as bold).

      7 . Physical Tags
These tags directly impact the visual appearance of the text, altering font styles, sizes, and other visual properties.
